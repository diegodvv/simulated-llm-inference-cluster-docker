 Here is a simple example of a Docker Compose file that sets up an Nginx server with a PostgreSQL database. This setup assumes you have the Docker and Docker Compose installed on       
your system.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secretpassword
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - db
    restart: always
```

In this example:

1. The `db` service uses the official PostgreSQL image and sets up a user, password, and database for our application. It also opens port 5432 (the default PostgreSQL port) on 
your host machine.

2. The `web` service runs the Nginx server with the configuration located at `./nginx.conf` in the current directory. It also forwards the host's port 80 to the container's port        
80.

3. The `web` service depends on the `db` service, meaning that it will not start until the PostgreSQL server is up and running.

4. Both services are set to restart automatically if they crash for some reason.
