This docker-compose file defines two services: web and db. The web service is built       
from the current directory (.), it exposes port 80, depends on the db service, and        
sets up environment variables for the Postgres URL. The db service uses an image of       
the latest Postgres version and sets up environment variables for the Postgres user,      
password, and database name.

The volume `- .:/app` mounts the current directory (.) into the container's /app
directory, allowing you to access the application code from inside the container.
