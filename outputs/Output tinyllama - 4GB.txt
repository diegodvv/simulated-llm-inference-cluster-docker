Docker Compose File:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:12-alpine
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./db/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  app:
    build: .
    command: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT -b $BUILD_PROCESS_KEY --port $PORT
    ports:
      - "3000:$PORT"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
      - ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build.gem:/usr/local/bin/ruby-build
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      ENVIRONMENT: "production"
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://postgres@db/myapp"

volumes:
  db: {}
```

Explanation:

1. `version`: Version of Docker Compose to use (here is latest `3.7`).
2. `services`: Defines the services within the compose file (`db` and `app`).
   - `db` image: Downloads, builds and starts a Postgres database container (from image `postgres:12-alpine`) with default settings.
   - `volumes`: Volumes are directories that are shared between containers (i.e. They are mounted). Here, we have mounted our `/var/lib/postgresql` directory as `/app/db`, which        
will be used by the `app` container to store Postgres' data (including logs, etc.).
   - `command`: A list of command-line arguments for running rails server with the default settings. `bundle exec rails server -p $PORT -b $BUILD_PROCESS_KEY --port $PORT` runs
Rails with Postgres (from `/usr/local/bin/ruby-build`) and sets up a basic SSL certificate (with default settings).
   - `ports`: Maps port numbers to container ports (in this case, 3000 maps to 80).
   - `environment`: Environment variables that can be set in the image or during build time. Here, we've defined an environment variable named `ENVIRONMENT` with a value of 
"production".
3. `db`: Volumes (from previous section) and environment variables (defined in previous section).
